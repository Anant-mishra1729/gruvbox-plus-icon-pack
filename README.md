Icon Pack for Linux (KDE, XFCE, Gnome) based on and inspired by:

* [Suru++](https://github.com/gusbemacbe/suru-plus)
* [OneDark](https://github.com/adhec/one-dark-icons)
* [Gruvbox icon pack](https://store.kde.org/p/1327720/)
* [GruvboxMateria](https://github.com/FilipeMCruz/dotfiles/tree/master/current/icons/.local/share/icons/MateriaGruvbox)
* and original Breeze Dark from KDE.

GruvboxPlus is using color scheme from [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox), both dark and light color palette.

Colours of icons were created with the thought of dark backgrounds, so it's recommend to use dark themes.
